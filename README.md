# Email Etiquette
How to send emails or messages over Teams.

* **Think: Is it necessary to send this mail?  Maybe the answer is already in the syllabus.**
  - If possible, ask in the classroom or in Teams.  It may be a good question, others may benefit.
* **Do have a subject! Mention which course your email is about.**
  - Good Subjects: 'CS 377 project', 'CS105 registration' etc.
  - Bad Subjects: 'Hello', 'My class', 'Class Project', or No Subject at all.
* **Use a professional salutation, send from your school email.**
* **Be concise, write clearly.**
  - Do not use long-winded sentences. Use punctuation.  
* **Try to send between working hours (8:30-17:00), and on weekdays.**
  - We also have a life outside the work, and I do not want to turn the notificiations off to reply fast.
